## Project Description

We created a Morse code lock system using a flashlight and light sensor. Users sets a 3-digit password and unlock it with the correct Morse code. LEDs show success or failure, and an LCD displays entered digits.

### Technical Approach

We implemented a state machine to handle lock/unlock states, with a timer and device initialization. Handlers convert flashlight signals to Morse code, store passwords, and update LEDs and LCD.
