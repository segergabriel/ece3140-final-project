### Project Description

We want to create a morse code lock system using a flashlight and the light sensor. First, the user will set a 3 digit password using the flashlight and with the implementation of morse code, then the user will use the flashlight to unlock it, if the right code is passed in. We will use the LEDs to show if the password is right or wrong and the LCD display will display what digit the user entered. A reset functionality will also be looked into being implemented. 
### Technical Approach

We will use a state machine in order to decide if the program is in the lock or unlock state. We will also use the timer handler we have been using throughout the course. An Init function that will set up all devices we need to use to run the project. We will also use a similar lock structure that we have been using in class for projects, helping to store the password. 

 

Additional peripherals and features that we will have to use but still looking into solutions for are a handler for the flashlight, a function to convert the Morse code into digits and the implementations for LCD and LEDs.
