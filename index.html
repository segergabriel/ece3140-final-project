  <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>With security and privacy becoming a more prominent problem in our society, we wanted to create a different kind of lock system. 
  So, we created a morse code lock system using a flashlight and the light sensor. The system consists of two major sections. First, the 
  user will set a 3 digit password via morse code, using a flashlight as input. Secondly, the user will be able to unlock the system with the 
  flashlight if the right password is passed. The LEDs will show if the password is right or wrong, flashing red or green, and the LCD display 
  will display what digit the user entered.</p>
    
  <h3>System Overview</h3>  
    <p>The system works by first having the user use SW3 to enter a 4 digit passcode. The code is entered in morse code with a dot being signified by a short 
      button press and dash being signified by a longer button press. Waiting an interval of approximately 1 second or more signifies that a new number is being 
      entered. The converted morse code will be shown as a digit on the LCD. After the full passcode is recorded using SW3, it can be entered by pressing SW1 one 
      time. This will set the passcode and lock the “gate” while turning on a red light, indicating that the system is locked. From there, the user can enter 
      passcodes and if the passcode is correct, it will toggle the gate and the green LED will turn on, if not the gate will not change. </p>
    
     <h3>What We Learned</h3>  
    <p>We have learned how to use a Finite State Machine to keep track of the state of our lock. Additionally, we have learned how to initialize and set up 
      PIT interrupts to keep track of a global time variable. This project also allowed us to learn how to detect button presses using interrupts and be able
      to map these button presses to an LCD screen which we learned how to set up and use. </p>

    <h3>System Description</h3>
    
    <h4>current_time, local_time and button_presses:</h4>
 
     <p>These are global variables that are used to keep track of the time in between button presses and how many button presses have occurred. 
       The current time is incremented every millisecond by a PIT interrupt that we set up on channel 1 to call the PIT1_Service() function. 
       The local_time variable is set to the current_time every time SW3 is pressed down or up. This allows us to keep track of the amount of time in
       between button presses and how fast the button is pressed. Keeping track of the number of button presses is important because the button needs to 
       be both pressed down <b>and</b> released to count as one input which would be recorded as 2 button presses. As a result, we only wanted to record morse 
       code input when the number of button presses is even.s</p>
