<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>With security and privacy becoming a more prominent problem in our society, we wanted to create a different kind of lock system. So, we created a morse code lock system using a flashlight and the light sensor. The system consists of two major sections. First, the user will set a 3 digit password via morse code, using a flashlight as input. Secondly, the user will be able to unlock the system with the flashlight if the right password is passed. The LEDs will show if the password is right or wrong, flashing red or green, and the LCD display will display what digit the user entered.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
<p> We have met over zoom at two occasions, with most of the time so far being spent on planning our project and set up this website. We believe that we have a good plan moving forward as we have a solid draft for both our diagrams and the code section. We have set up the project and are aware of different peripherals we need to use. So, the next step for us is to start building the project and code, as it will take some time to get everything to work together.</p>

<h3>System Overview</h3>
<p>We will use a state machine in order to decide if the program is in the lock or unlock state. We will also use the timer handler we have been using throughout the course. Additionally, we will have an Init function that will set up all devices we need to run the project. We will also use a similar lock structure that we have been using in class for projects, which will help to store the password. Our code will be written in C and GitHub will be used as a contol system and to monitor this website. </p>
<p>To register user input, we will use a flashlight to input the morse code. A short flash (<1s) will be a dot and a longer flash (>2s) will be a dash. These will be displayed as the morse digit on the LCD, to help the user. When the password is set, the user can unlock the system by plugging in the same combination. The Green LED will flash if the password is right, otherwise the red LED will flash. </p>
