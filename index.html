<h3>Introduction (Draft)</h3>
<p>With security and privacy becoming a more prominent problem in our society, we wanted to create a different kind of lock system. 
  So, we created a morse code lock system using a flashlight and the light sensor. The system consists of two major sections. First, the 
  user will set a 3 digit password via morse code, using a flashlight as input. Secondly, the user will be able to unlock the system with the 
  flashlight if the right password is passed. The LEDs will show if the password is right or wrong, flashing red or green, and the LCD display 
  will display what digit the user entered.Our project was motivated by the fundamental usefulness and practicality of morse code combined with the 
  importance of being able to have security features such as password locks. It is important to have a way to implement security even when you have 
  very few methods of inputs. In certain scenarios, you will not be able to have a full number pad or more than just a few input devices. As a 
  result we designed our locking mechanism to only use two buttons on the board and be based on the timing of the button press to convert inputs 
  into morse code which will allow you to enter a password to a lock.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
<p> We have met over zoom at two occasions, with most of the time so far being spent on planning our project and set up this website. We believe that we have a good plan moving forward as we have a solid draft for both our diagrams and the code section. We have set up the project and are aware of different peripherals we need to use. So, the next step for us is to start building the project and code, as it will take some time to get everything to work together.</p>
<hr>  

<h3>System Overview</h3>
<p>The system works by first having the user use SW3 to enter a 4 digit passcode. The code is entered in morse code with a dot being signified by a short 
  button press and dash being signified by a longer button press. Waiting an interval of approximately 1 second or more signifies that a new number is being 
  entered. The converted morse code will be shown as a digit on the LCD. After the full passcode is recorded using SW3, it can be entered by pressing SW1 one
  time. This will set the passcode and lock the “gate” while turning on a red light, indicating that the system is locked. From there, the user can enter 
  passcodes and if the passcode is correct, it will toggle the gate and the green LED will turn on, if not the gate will not change. </p>

<h3>What We Learned</h3>
 <p>We have learned how to use a Finite State Machine to keep track of the state of our lock. Additionally, we have learned how to initialize and 
   set up PIT interrupts to keep track of a global time variable. This project also allowed us to learn how to detect button presses using interrupts and 
   be able to map these button presses to an LCD screen which we learned how to set up and use</p>

<h3>Work Distribution</h3>
  <p>We mostly collaborated via text and Zoom as we couldn't find a common time to work in person for the majority of the project due to other obligations. 
    We were still able to collaborate and communicate effectively as we had daily contact regarding updates. Fortunately, we managed to get together in the last
    two days to produce the video and debug it together. We began the project via Zoom, where we both contributed with ideas and roughly planned the project. 
    We then continued to do a great deal of coding during our zoom meetings, which began last week and continued through the weekend. Dakari had the board, 
    but we reviewed any code we designed  together online. Both took an active role in writing test cases and working with the web page. Other than Zoom and text,
    we used Google Drive and Github to share code with each other.

<h3> Project Video Demo </h3> 
Here is a more detailed breakdown of what the different sections should have. 
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ol>
<li>Motivation of your project. If appropriate, consider the impact of your system public health, safety, and 
  welfare as well as relevant global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.</li>
<li>Describes briefly what their system does.</li>
<li>Include any necessary background information.</li>
<li>Summary of what you have accomplished and what you have learned.</li>
</ol>

<h4> System Overview and diagram </h4>
Give a high-level description of how the system works and how the different parts work together. 
Include a block diagram of the system showing how components interact. This diagram could potentially be replaced by very clear writing. (You don't need the diagram for the web check-in).
      
<h4>Video</h4> 
The video should have the right length (3-4 min, if shorter than 2 min or longer than 5 mins, we will deduct points) 
The video should be self-contained, i.e. understandable by someone who has not read your whole website.
<ol>
<li> Give a brief overview of the project. </li>
<li> Show the system working. </li>
<li> Describe some of the technical details. </li>
</ol> 

<ul>
<li> What would be the most interesting piece of information for your fellow students? </li>
<li> Was there a super tricky bug? </li>
<li> Something surprising you learned during the implementation? </li>
<li> Did you come up with some super clever tests? </li>
</ul>
      
<h4> Technical description </h4>
<ol>
<li> Explains how their system/software works. </li>
<li> Should be at an appropriate level of detail to allow you to evaluate their design decisions. </li>
<li> Projects with additional hardware must include a schematic. </li>
</ol>
      
<h4> Testing </h4>
<ol>
<li> Describes their testing procedure and how they determined the system works correctly. </li>
<li> Some projects may not have traditional test cases (e.g. tested the system by human interaction with it), but all projects must be tested. </li>
</ol>
<h4> Work Distribution </h4>
Talk about how you split up the work and made sure that everyone contributed.
