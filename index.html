<h3>Welcome to your ECE3140 / CS 3420 GitHub Page!</h3>
<p>This branch of the project is set up as a basic project web-page for you to edit.</p> 
<p>You should update (and remove) this text.</p>  
<p>You can edit this file direclty or use any other method to update/generate your page. In order to update the material, 
    push to the "gh-pages" branch. Also note, that while the repo is private the <strong>page content is public</strong>.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Web Check-In</h3>

<p>Please remove this page and write a short paragraph on your progress to date and make a draft for the System Overview 
    section. Are there any major obstacles?</p>
<p>You can also start putting in the structure for the final page, but we will only be looking at the System Overview 
     for now. Your project page should have the following sections (which are similar to the lab reports).</p>

<ul>
<li>A Descriptive Project Name</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>System Overview &lt;--- Draft for Web Check In</li>
<li>Project Video Demo (~3-4min)</li>
<li>Detailed Technical Description</li>
<li>Additional Resources Used</li>
<li>Work Distribution (skip if you work by yourself)</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3> Section Details </h3> 
Here is a more detailed breakdown of what the different sections should have. 
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ol>
<li>Motivation of your project. If appropriate, consider the impact of your system public health, safety, and 
  welfare as well as relevant global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.</li>
<li>Describes briefly what their system does.</li>
<li>Include any necessary background information.</li>
<li>Summary of what you have accomplished and what you have learned.</li>
</ol>

<h4> System Overview and diagram </h4>
Give a high-level description of how the system works and how the different parts work together. 
Include a block diagram of the system showing how components interact. This diagram could potentially be replaced by very clear writing. (You don't need the diagram for the web check-in).
      
<h4>Video</h4> 
The video should have the right length (3-4 min, if shorter than 2 min or longer than 5 mins, we will deduct points) 
The video should be self-contained, i.e. understandable by someone who has not read your whole website.
<ol>
<li> Give a brief overview of the project. </li>
<li> Show the system working. </li>
<li> Describe some of the technical details. </li>
</ol> 

<ul>
<li> What would be the most interesting piece of information for your fellow students? </li>
<li> Was there a super tricky bug? </li>
<li> Something surprising you learned during the implementation? </li>
<li> Did you come up with some super clever tests? </li>
</ul>
      
<h4> Technical description </h4>
<ol>
<li> Explains how their system/software works. </li>
<li> Should be at an appropriate level of detail to allow you to evaluate their design decisions. </li>
<li> Projects with additional hardware must include a schematic. </li>
</ol>
      
<h4> Testing </h4>
<ol>
<li> Describes their testing procedure and how they determined the system works correctly. </li>
<li> Some projects may not have traditional test cases (e.g. tested the system by human interaction with it), but all projects must be tested. </li>
</ol>
<h4> Work Distribution </h4>
Talk about how you split up the work and made sure that everyone contributed.
